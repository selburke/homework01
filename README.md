# Homework-01
Homework-01 was a project focused on refactoring code. Specifically, updating the file to semantic HTML & editing the related CSS as necessary.

In this project, I assessed & modified the HTML Elements in order to provide a higher level of accessibility. Elements such as <div> were replaced with specified elements such as <article>,<section>, and <aside> to provide viewers with easier understanding. I also updated the HTML to include the best practices for class/id naming and indentation.
